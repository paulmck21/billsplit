# Bill Split

This is a tiny project to split bills. 
I set myself the task of making a bill splitting app while on an RV travelling around Quebec. There was no internet, 6 people, lots of bills and even more confusion. 

**Requirements:**
* Must work offline.
* Must not use any libraries or tools (no internet to develop with)
* Users are able to split bills where only some of the group are involved.
* Users can add group members as they go.
* Users are given a run down at the end of total amount owed by / to each person, so each person can make one lump payment.
* NO USE OF ANY SEARCH ENGINE, all code must be written from memory. No docs or help of any kind.


## Future

This was a fun little thing. It is in no way finished, however I will not be adding to it here, but thinking of making a version of it in using more... modern tools.
